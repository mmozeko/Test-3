## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?
    My recommendation would be to continue to focus on the smart contracts and oracle functionality
    Finding a unique way to campture transactional data and automate via Smart Contracts will be the future.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    By capturing transactional data, employing smart contracts to eliminate a third party will
    increase use of the LINK coin.  The utility of the LINK coin would increase the value of the coin as
    customers use it to their benefit.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
    The use of smart contracts in addition to ioT data feeds can be used to automate
    the transactional events which will drive smart contracts to provide value to customers.

    Automation, transparency, and immutability of the transaction are
    essential for customer satisfaction.
